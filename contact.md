# Contact Info.

### Email:
As is true for most, the best way to contact me is through email!
<br><a href="mailto:catherine.m.slaughter@gmail.com"> <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i> Catherine.M.Slaughter@gmail.com</a>

### Snail Mail:
As I'm in the process of moving to The Netherlands, I don't have a mailing address I can simply post online at the moment. Please consider sending me an email!

### Online:
Links to other online forms of contact can be found in the sidebar.
<!--You can find me on most social media platforms with the handle @catieslaughts !-->

### Other:
For the particularly young at heart, my Nintendo Online friend code is SW-7325-4321-5044. My Animal Crossing island has an observatory. I will, however, strongly recommend sticking to email for any time-sensitive communications.
