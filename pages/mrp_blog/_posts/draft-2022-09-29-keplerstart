Today I set up and ran the Kepler code on my computer. It seems to run correctly, albeit a little slow. 

The code, as it was given to me, throws two depriciation warnings of the same type on lines 256 and 259:
    VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated. If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray
I don't foresee this causing any issues but wanted to note just in case.

I also read through the docstrings of the various functions. My thoughts and questions are listed below.

- kepler_solve:
  - The first guess for the eccentric anomaly E is the mean anomaly M. Does E = M in the case of a circular orbit?
    - edit: Yes, this is clearly the case when looking at the transcendental equation, e goes to 0 so E = M
