Today was focused on getting organized + preparing my workflow. 

Tasks completed:
- set up this blog, made sure everything is set to run smoothly
- made a [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17MGI1IRplcB-k7Lhuhfod17BntLvLkOx?usp=sharing)
- created a [github repo](https://github.com/catieslaughts/MRP_2022) with showyourwork
  - connected an [overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nqsqzbcwbbnf) to the showyourwork repo on setup
  - downloaded kepler3.py from email and put it up on the repo in the "code" directory
    - keeping this separate from the showyourwork "src/tex/scripts" directory for now, I think that's meant to be for the scripts that are actually used to create figures
- created an [overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wdmvscbmmrpt) with the LION MS thesis template

Next steps:
- run and play with the kepler code, read through function docstrings to get a feel for how code is working
  - vizualization
- deeper dive into the Jackson 2014 paper, especially appendix A
  - await his email response
