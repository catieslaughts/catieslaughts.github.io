# Outreach
I am a firm believer that public education and outreach are a crucial part of scientific work. Outreach helps us to educate, spark an interest in the sciences in young people, and learn how to express ourselves and describe our work to a wide variety of audiences. My outreach work has helped me to understand my research on a more fundamental level, and I am a better scientist for it.

## Past Work
**Different outreach groups/opportunities I have been involved with!**

### Central Idaho Dark Sky Reserve Astronomer-in-Residence, June-July 2022
Starting in summer 2022, the AstroTAC group at Boise State (with outreach funding from NASA) is hiring an astronomer-in-residence (analogous to an artist-in-residence) to spend 4 weeks at CISDR doing public outreach work with the community! A great opportunity in a beautiful setting!

### Skype a Scientist, 2021-2022
This nonprofit works to connect real scientists with students of all ages for virtual classroom visits, Q and A sessions, and more! Educators can learn more on their <a href='https://www.skypeascientist.com/' target='_blank'> website</a> (feel free to search my name)!

### Dartmouth College Public Observing, 2018-2021
If you find yourself in Hanover, come stop by on Friday nights when classes are in session to the Department of Physics and Astronomy's <a href='https://physics.dartmouth.edu/news-events/public-observing' target='_blank'> Public Observing </a> sessions! Updates on observing times and scheduling can be found on the Dartmouth PandA PO <a href='https://www.instagram.com/dartmouthpo/' target='_blank'> Instagram account.</a>

### Dartmouth ManyMentors, 2019
A penpal and school outreach program! "Making STEM opportunities more visible, valuable, and viable for underrepresented k-12 students in rural Vermont and New Hampshire." -<a href='https://www.dartmouthmanymentors.org/' target='_blank'>ManyMentors Website </a>

### Mountains of Stars, Summer 2018
A summertime program along the Appalacian Trail in Maine and New Hampshire. Undergraduates work as <a href='https://www.mountainsofstars.org/' target='_blank'> astronomy and nature guides</a>, connecting people to environmental issues through a common human interest in the stars. 

## For Educators:
Are you an educator covering physics and/or astronomy and looking for a classroom visit? I'm no Bill Nye, but I love chatting with young people about space, science, and their possible futures in both! Feel free to look up my name on <a href='https://www.skypeascientist.com/' target='_blank'> Skype a Scientist</a>. If I'm out of sessions for the year, consider sending me an email. We can do our best to work something out!

Looking to start your students in the sciences? May I reccomend <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/' target='_blank'>Scratch</a>? This applet, originally created at MIT, was my first introduction to coding, and I still love to play around with it today!
