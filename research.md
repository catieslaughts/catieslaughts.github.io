# Research
Descriptions of current research projects and ongoing research interests.
<br>An extended list of past significant research projects can be found on my <a href="http://www.catherineslaughter.space/projects/">projects</a> page.

## Interests
My research interests generally lie at the intersection between observational and computational astrophysics. As I look to apply to PhD programs starting in Fall 2023, I am hoping to pursue computational applications to the study of stellar and planetary astronomy. In particular, I am interested in modeling (and analyzing data related to) the formation, evolution, and death of stars and stellar systems. I would be interested to see such research applied to study of Pop. III stars. I believe a better understanding of the conditions under which such stars form and could possibly live to today will be beneficial to the search for observable Pop. III stars, and have greater applications to our understanding of Big Bang Nucleosythesis and early universe cosmology.

(Are you a professor with related research interests looking to expand your research group in the next application cycle? I would be honored to work with you!)

## First-Year Master's Research
My current research project is being conducted under the guidance of Prof. Xander Tielens and Dr. Cornelia Pabst at Sterrewacht Leiden. Inspired by the work of Dr. Bob O'Dell [(O'Dell et al. 2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...837..151O/abstract) I am using SOFIA data and a radiation field code developed by Ramsey Karim at the University of Maryland to search for regions of the greater Orion Nebula where ionizing radiation may be dominated by stars other than Theta 1 Orionis C, the brightest star in the Trapezium cluster. I am doing this by comparing patterns in line emission from the nebula medium with expected radiation field values at different regions of the sky. 

## Culminating Undergraduate Research
At Dartmouth, all my resarch lead up to my culminating undergraduate experience, advised by Prof. Brian Chaboyer. The Chaboyer Group at Dartmouth College focuses on research in stellar evolution. In particular, the group helps maintain and calibrate DSED evolution models, and uses the database to study stellar population formation of the Milky Way, satellite galaxies, globular clusters, etc.

The purpose of my project was to estimate the ages of several globular clusters in the Milky Way. These clusters contain the oldest stars in the galaxy, and determining the age of them provides a strict lower limit on the overall age of the universe. In order to do this, I am implementing a Monte-Carlo Main Sequence Fitting method using DSED models and Gaia parallax data, as done in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa6574" target="_blank">O’Malley et al. 2017</a>, to find my age estimate. I can further reduce the error in this value using numerical analysis methods as outlined in  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/332/1/91/975077" target="_blank">Dolphin 2001</a>. This method looks at the number densities of stars in the cluster at certain places in their evolution. In particular, I’ll be looking at stars at and just beyond the main sequence turnoff, because evolution occurs much more quickly starting at this point. This project utilizes Gaia parallax distance data, and error can be further reduced with the release of Gaia DR3. 

The limit estimated will be useful in further research related to the Hubble Tension—a discrepancy in experimental findings which can estimate the age of the universe. The value for the age of the universe impacts what we know about cosmology going all the way back to the Big Bang, and is essential to the cosmological standard model. Because the distances to the clusters studied can be found via parallax, the value obtained in this project will not be impacted by potential error in the distance ladder. The lower limit estimated will serve as a useful boundary condition in studying the Hubble Tension.
