# Research
Descriptions of current research projects and ongoing research interests.
<br>An extended list of past significant research projects can be found on my <a href="http://www.catherineslaughter.space/projects/">projects</a> page.

## First-Year Master's Research
My current research project is being conducted under the guidance of Prof. Xander Tielens at Sterrewacht Leiden. Under the direct supervision of Dr. Cornelia Pabst, I am using Gaia EDR3 and SOFIA IR data from the Tielens group to further analyze and probe the barriers to and drivers of star formation in the veil region surrounding θ1 Ori C in the Orion Nebula.

## Culminating Undergraduate Research
At Dartmouth, all my resarch lead up to my culminating undergraduate experience, advised by Prof. Brian Chaboyer. The Chaboyer Group at Dartmouth College focuses on research in stellar evolution. In particular, the group helps maintain and calibrate DSED evolution models, and uses the database to study stellar population formation of the Milky Way, satellite galaxies, globular clusters, etc.

The purpose of my project is to estimate the ages of several globular clusters in the Milky Way. These clusters contain the oldest stars in the galaxy, and determining the age of them provides a strict lower limit on the overall age of the universe. In order to do this, I am implementing a Monte-Carlo Main Sequence Fitting method using DSED models and Gaia parallax data, as done in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa6574" target="_blank">O’Malley et al. 2017</a>, to find my age estimate. I can further reduce the error in this value using numerical analysis methods as outlined in  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/332/1/91/975077" target="_blank">Dolphin 2001</a>. This method looks at the number densities of stars in the cluster at certain places in their evolution. In particular, I’ll be looking at stars at and just beyond the main sequence turnoff, because evolution occurs much more quickly starting at this point. This project utilizes Gaia parallax distance data, and error can be further reduced with the release of Gaia DR3. 

The limit estimated will be useful in further research related to the Hubble Tension—a discrepancy in experimental findings which can estimate the age of the universe. The value for the age of the universe impacts what we know about cosmology going all the way back to the Big Bang, and is essential to the cosmological standard model. Because the distances to the clusters studied can be found via parallax, the value obtained in this project will not be impacted by potential error in the distance ladder. The lower limit estimated will serve as a useful boundary condition in studying the Hubble Tension.

## Interests
I am generally interested in the intersection of observational and computational astrophysics. Along with having taken many classes with research-based components and having gone observing on several observing runs, I have taken Computer Science coursework well beyond what is required for my undergraduate degree, and consistently apply the skills learned in those classes to my research.

Specific research interests include (but are not limited to):

* Stellar Evolution Modeling
    * Pop II stars
    * Milky-way globular clusters
        * Main-sequence fitting and assorted numerical analyses
    * Search for Pop III stars and stellar remnants
    
* High-energy Stellar Systems
    * X-ray Binary systems
        * Modelling reflection features in Xspec
        * NuSTAR observations
        * Analysis of serendipidous straylight observations

* Anything Smaller in scale than the Milky Way
   * Yes, I'm aware this is very broad
   * Quantum Astrophysics
