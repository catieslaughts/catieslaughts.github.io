# Research

## Ongoing Interests

I am generally interested in observational and computational astrophysics. Along with having taken many classes with research-based components and having gone observing on several observing runs, I have taken Computer Science coursework well beyond what is required for my undergraduate degree, and consistently apply those skills to my research.

Topics of current research include:

* Stellar Evolution Modeling
    * Pop II stars
    * Milky-way globular cluster systems
        * Main-sequence fitting and assorted numerical analyses
    * Search for Pop III stars and stellar remnants
    
* High-energy Stellar Systems
    * X-ray Binary systems
        * Modelling reflection features in Xspec
        * NuSTAR observations
        * Analysis of serendipidous straylight observations
