# Introduction
Hi! I'm Catherine and I am a fourth-year undergraduate studying Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH. After graduating in June 2021, I plan to pursue a PhD in astronomy and astrophysics (please let me into your grad program). I am passionate about STEM education and outreach, and want to continue working with the general public along with conducting my research. I am dedicated to affirmative inclusivity in the sciences--not just "diversity"--working both toward personal growth and institutional change. I have served as a mentor for underprivileged students, and helped found a BIPOC big sibling program at my small, all-women's high school. This program aims to help students of color combat imposter syndrome, and to encourage them to pursue any field of interest! Outside of school and research, I am a huge Chicago Cubs baseball fan, ukulele player, and avid hiker. 

Although I've been told many times to not open with this, I have wanted to be an astronomer since the 4th grade, and as I've spent my undergrad working on research, my love of the subject has only grown. From spending my first year doing grunt work to presently working on two separate first-author publications. My research work is some of the most fulfilling work I've ever done, and I look forward to pursuing it further. Ultimately, my end goal is to work as a professor, teaching students, doing public education, and conducting research. Examples of past work and a copy of my current CV can be found at the menu above.



## Personal Statement:
**Originally written for PhD program applications, the following gives a detailed and relatively brief overview of my research experiences and professional goals.**

A lot of people like astronomy, it’s easy to like astronomy. What could be more beautiful than a clear, dark sky full of stars? Over the course of my undergraduate career I’ve learned what it means to be truly passionate for this field of study. From finding joy in the grunt work of filling out a spreadsheet, to the first time I saw my name listed as an author, my undergraduate work in astronomy has been the most fulfilling work I’ve ever experienced. Throughout this time, I've developed two main professional goals. The first and primary goal is to continue to conduct research at the forefront of astrophysics, ideally as a professor. I have a particular interest in the intersection of observational and computational astronomy, where new technology can be used to improve and accelerate our knowledge of astrophysics. My second goal is to work with the general public. I am passionate about public outreach in STEM and believe that encouraging people to engage with science is an absolutely critical part of being a scientist. During my undergraduate years, I have gained experience on both of these fronts, and I believe that a PhD-track graduate education is the best next step for me.

My first research experience began in January of 2018, during my freshman year. I had the pleasure of working under Dr. Brian Chaboyer, testing and refining models in the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program (DSEP) database. With Gaia DR2, we had access to higher precision parallax measurements for a greater number of calibrating stars. For this project, I was tasked with determining the metallicities of a large group of Pop. II subdwarfs. Using iraf’s SPLOT program, I measured the equivalent widths of ~150 absorption lines in the spectra of ~60 stars. I then took the metallicity data and used MOOG software to create atmosphere models for each star. At one point, an we identified an error in the data reduction pipeline we'd utilized which rendered six weeks data that I had collected as useless; despite the setback, I loved what I was doing. This setback was important, as it underscored in my mind what it meant to study astrophysics as a researcher, not just a student. In the end, we confirmed our expectation that current stellar evolution models do not fit metal-poor stars as well as they fit solar-metallicity stars. I presented these results at the Wetterhan Science Symposium on campus in May 2018. I continued working on this project through the end of 2019. I was honored to be listed as third author on a paper related to this work, entitled “Metal-Poor Calibrating Subdwarfs in the Gaia Era,” which was submitted for publication in July 2020.

In January of 2019, I participated in a study abroad trip through Dartmouth’s department of Physics and Astronomy to Cape Town, South Africa, led by Dr. John Thorstensen. As part of this trip, I participated in a week-long observing run at the Southern African Astronomical Observatory. While we spent the majority of our time conducting observations on behalf of professors in the department, I was allotted time on the 1m telescope. I obtained absolute photometric data on a number of sources related to my work with Dr. Chaboyer. Under the supervision of a graduate student, I drove the telescope for several hours over the course of a few nights. I had never been in charge of a telescope worth more than a few hundred dollars, much less a professional grade telescope. It was a phenomenal experience. I was fortunate enough to participate in another observing run at MDM observatory on Kitt Peak later that same year.

My next major research experience started in June 2020, and is still in progress. During my summer break, I worked as a Student Undergraduate Research Fellow at Caltech. I worked under Dr. Fiona Harrison and the NuSTAR group there, specifically working alongside research scientist Dr. Brian Grefenstette. NuSTAR was designed with a deployable mast that is largely open to the space around it. As such, it is not uncommon for stray photons from sources within 1-4 degrees of the line of sight to reach the optics of the scope without being focused first. My work analyzes these “straylight” data of several z-track neutron star binary sources. I’m utilizing Xspec software to fit relxillNS models to the straylight spectral data of the sources to compare model parameters to what currently exists in the literature. Straylight observations have tremendous potential value in the study of transient events from x-ray sources, and have largely gone unexamined. Some of my ongoing work is featured in a related catalog paper (Grefenstette et al. submitted 2020), and I am working on a first-author publication of an in-depth straylight analysis of source GX17+2.

My second current research project is my senior honors thesis, which I’ve been working on since March 2020. Advised by Dr. Chaboyer, I aim to determine the age of several milky-way globular clusters with higher precision than has been accomplished previously. Working on Dartmouth’s super-computing server, I am using Python and Bash scripts to perform Monte Carlo simulations of some 10,000 different DSEP isochrone models for each of our clusters. From here, I perform main-sequence fitting in order to determine an initial estimate for the age of each cluster. I then implement a new numerical analysis method in order to further reduce the error in the calculated age. This method involves analyzing the number density of stars from a cluster just at and beyond the main-sequence turnoff. This work has potential use in further research related to the Hubble Tension. I presented my preliminary Monte Carlo simulations in a virtual poster session for the Department of Physics and Astronomy in May 2020, and intend to pursue a paper worthy of publication by May 2021. 

While my research experience has certainly been significant, I’ve also found a passion for outreach, with a particular interest in promoting inclusion in STEM. For several years, I’ve worked as a tutor for first-year students taking physics classes through Dartmouth Emerging Engineers. I’ve also worked as a teaching assistant for introductory astronomy courses targeting non-science majors, mostly teaching labs. I am a Dartmouth Manymentors pen pal, reaching out to young students--especially minority students in local rural communities--to share my experiences in the sciences. I’ve been fortunate as well, to have logged hundreds of hours leading public observing, sharing an interest in astronomy with people ranging from young children to tenured professors. I firmly believe that work like this makes me a better scientist, and helps me understand my own work at a more fundamental level.
