# Introduction

Hi! I'm Catherine and I am a fourth-year undergraduate studying Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH. After graduating in June 2021, I will be pursuing a Master's degree in Astronomical Research at Leiden University in the Netherlands. I am dedicated researcher and I love to tackle problems big and small. In general, I describe my [research interests](http://www.catherineslaughter.space/research/) as "anything equal or smaller in scale to the Milky Way." This has included (but is most definitely not limited to) stellar evolution and remnants, ISM, and quantum/atomic astrophysics. That being said, I am still very early in my career, and willing to work on just about anything!

I am passionate about [public outreach](http://www.catherineslaughter.space/outreach/) in STEM and believe that encouraging people to engage with science is an absolutely critical part of being a scientist. I believe in affirmative inclusivity in the sciences, and am always trying to work on personal growth and for institutional change. 

Outside of school and research, I am a huge Chicago Cubs fan, ukulele player, and avid hiker.
