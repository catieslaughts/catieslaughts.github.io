Hi, I'm Catherine Slaughter. I am an undergraduate in the class of 2021 studying Physics and Astronomy Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH. After graduating, I plan to continue my education in an Astrophysics PhD program. I am passionate about STEM education and outreach, and want to continue working with the general public along with conducting my research. Outside of school and research, I am a **huge** Chicago Cubs baseball fan, I play the ukulele, and I love to travel.
