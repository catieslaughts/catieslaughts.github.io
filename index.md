# Introduction

A lot of people like astronomy, it’s easy to like astronomy. What could be more beautiful than a clear, dark sky full of stars? Over the course of my undergraduate career I’ve learned what it means to be truly passionate for this field of study. From finding joy in the grunt work of filling out a spreadsheet, to the first time I saw my name listed as an author, my undergraduate work in astronomy has been the most fulfilling work I’ve ever experienced. Throughout this time, I've developed two main professional goals. The first and primary goal is to continue to conduct research at the forefront of astrophysics, ideally as a professor. I have a particular interest in the intersection of observational and computational astronomy, where new technology can be used to improve and accelerate our knowledge of astrophysics. My second goal is to work with the general public. I am passionate about public outreach in STEM and believe that encouraging people to engage with science is an absolutely critical part of being a scientist.

Hi! I'm Catherine and I am a fourth-year undergraduate studying Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH. After graduating in June 2021, I plan to pursue a PhD in astronomy and astrophysics (please let me into your grad program). I am passionate about STEM education and outreach, and want to continue working with the general public along with conducting my research. I am dedicated to affirmative inclusivity in the sciences--not just "diversity"--working both toward personal growth and institutional change. I have served as a mentor for underprivileged students, and helped found a BIPOC big sibling program at my small, all-women's high school. This program aims to help students of color combat imposter syndrome, and to encourage them to pursue any field of interest! Outside of school and research, I am a huge Chicago Cubs fan, ukulele player, and avid hiker.
