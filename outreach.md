# Outreach
I am a firm believer that public education and outreach are a crucial part of scientific work. Outreach helps us to educate, spark an interest in the sciences in young people, and learn how to express ourselves and describe our work to a wide variety of audiences. My outreach work has helped me to understand my research on a more fundamental level, and I am a better scientist for it.

## Opportunities
**Different outreach groups/opportunities I am/have been involved with!**
### Dartmouth College Public Observing
(Note: Public observing is not currently being held due to the Covid-19 pandemic)
<br> If you find yourself in Hanover, come stop by on Friday nights when classes are in session to the Department of Physics and Astronomy's <a href='https://physics.dartmouth.edu/news-events/public-observing'> Public Observing </a> sessions!

### Mountains of Stars
A summertime program along the Appalacian Trail in Maine and New Hampshire. Undergraduates work as <a href='https://www.mountainsofstars.org/'> astronomy and nature guides</a>, connecting people to environmental issues through a common human interest in the stars. 

### Dartmouth ManyMentors
A penpal and school outreach program! "Making STEM opportunities more visible, valuable, and viable for underrepresented k-12 students in rural Vermont and New Hampshire." -<a href='https://www.dartmouthmanymentors.org/'>ManyMentors Website </a>

### For Educators:
I'm admittedly probably not far enough in my career to have a "for educators" section of my outreach page, but I love chatting with young people about space, science, and their possible futures in both!
